This software is developed for Metatrader4 and is only experimental. It means it isn't usable trading system yet. You can use an idea used in this code in order to make your own trading system.

System is trying to find out where potential support and resistance levels are and detect moves from these levels. I was trying to make comments in code so it should be easy to find out what each part does.

**You have to install [metatrader-tools](https://github.com/michalbrauner/metatrader-tools) to use this system.**
